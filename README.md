# EvolML
This is a machine learning library tightly integrated with metaheuristic-designer that combines evolutionary computing and stochastic optimization techniques with machine learning methods.

This library provides the following tools:

## Feature selection
### - Masked feature selection

## Hyperparameter optimization
<!-- ### - Genetic Algorithm Optimizer  -->

## Machine learning models
### - Genetic K-Medoids
### - NEAT
### - WANN
### - Symbolic regression
